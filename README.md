# Pong (Games with Golang)

What it can do:
- Opens a game window using SDL 2.0 and play the classic pong game

How to build yourself:
- Install [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/) or ```brew install go```
- Install the SDL development libraries ```brew install sdl2```
- get the repo ```go get github.com/knighthawkbro/pong```
- cd to repo ```cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/knighthawkbro/pong```
- run ```go build pong.go```
- run ```.\pong.go```
- conversly you can just run ```go run pong.go``` for an instant execution of the program
- I think you may need to set your [$GOPATH](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH) and create a src folder within for go build to work
